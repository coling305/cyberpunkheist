Instructions:  
  
To start the game, launch it and select a difficulty level (Hard,
Medium, or Easy) by entering the corresponding number. Then, enter a
name for your character.  
The game map will be displayed, showing your position ('X'), banks
('B'), arms dealers ('A'), and empty spaces ('-').  
Each turn, you will be presented with options: Move, Interact, Call Arms
Dealer, View Inventory, View Past Games, or Exit.  
To move, choose a direction (Up, Down, Left, Right). Your position will
be updated on the map.  
If you land on a bank ('B'), you can gather intel to get information
about the bank's security, attempt a heist, or exit without taking
action. Heist success depends on your total weapon power and the bank's
security. Failure may result in losing a life and a weapon.  
You can summon an arms dealer to your location and choose the tier (Low,
Mid, High) based on your available money. You can buy weapons to
increase your total power, sell weapons to get money, or upgrade weapons
to improve their power.  
The game ends if you run out of lives or lose all your weapons. Upon
game over, your statistics (name, money, heists completed, total
earnings, weapons purchased, and weapons sold) will be recorded.  
You can view the statistics of previous games to see your progress and
performance.  
To win in Cyberpunk Heist you must balance risk and reward by
strategically planning your moves, gathering intel, and managing your
resources. The game ends when you successfully get rich through heists
without losing all your lives or weapons. Have fun and good luck on your
cyberpunk adventure!
